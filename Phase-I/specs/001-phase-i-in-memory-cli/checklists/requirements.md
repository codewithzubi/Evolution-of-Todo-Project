Specification is ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`).\n\nThe specification successfully captures Phase-I requirements without leaking implementation details. User stories are prioritized (P1: core functionality, P2: convenience features), acceptance criteria are comprehensive, and success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.\n\nEdge cases adequately cover:\n- Empty titles and whitespace validation\n- Non-numeric and invalid task IDs\n- Extra command arguments\n- Long titles and descriptions\n- Special character handling\n\nThe specification follows Spec-Driven Development principles and is complete enough for Claude Code to generate accurate implementation."]
