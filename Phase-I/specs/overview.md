# Phase-I Overview: Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

**Phase**: I
**Date**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: Active
**Project**: Hackathon-II: Spec-Driven Development - Evolution of Todo

---

## Phase Objective

Phase-I establishes the foundation of the Todo application with a minimal, in-memory command-line interface. This phase demonstrates Spec-Driven Development methodology by implementing core task management functionality using only in-memory storage.

The primary goals are:
- Validate SDD methodology with a simple implementation
- Establish core todo data model and business logic
- Provide working CLI interface for task management
- Create reusable intelligence for later phases

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Command-line interface for task management
- In-memory task storage
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Task completion status management
- Simple input validation and error handling

### Out of Scope

- Data persistence to files or databases
- User authentication
- Multiple user support
- Task categories or tags
- Due dates or scheduling
- Web or graphical user interface
- API endpoints
- Cloud deployment
- AI or chatbot features

---

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Language: Python 3.13+
- Storage: In-memory only (no files, no databases)
- Interface: Command-line interface (CLI) only
- Implementation: Must be generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)
- Architecture: Clean separation of concerns under `/src` directory

### Process Constraints

- All code must be spec-driven
- No implementation code written by developer
- Specifications must be refined until correct output is generated
- Constitution compliance mandatory

---

## Deliverables

### Specifications

- `specs/features/task-crud.md`: Task CRUD operations specification
- `specs/features/task-completion.md`: Task completion status specification
- `specs/ui/console-interface.md`: Console interface specification
- `specs/architecture.md`: Architecture and structure specification

### Implementation Artifacts (Generated Later)

- `/src/models/task.py`: Task data model
- `/src/services/task_service.py`: Task management logic
- `/src/cli/commands.py`: CLI command handlers
- `/src/main.py`: Application entry point
- Unit tests for core functionality

---

## Phase Exit Criteria

Phase-I is complete when:

1. All functional requirements are implemented
2. All acceptance criteria pass
3. Application can be executed via CLI
4. User can add, view, update, delete, and complete tasks
5. Specifications document all behavior accurately
6. Implementation matches specification exactly
7. Constitution compliance verified

---

## Transition to Phase-II

Phase-I intelligence that must remain reusable:
- Task data model (can be abstracted for persistence)
- Task business logic and validation rules
- CLI command structure and patterns
- Input validation logic

Phase-I elements that must remain unchanged:
- Task entity definition (id, title, description, completed)
- CRUD operation semantics
- User stories and acceptance criteria

Phase-II will add:
- File-based persistence layer
- Data serialization and deserialization
- Schema validation
- Enhanced error handling for persistence failures
