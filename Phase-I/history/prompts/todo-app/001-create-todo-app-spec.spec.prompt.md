# Create Todo App Feature Specification

## User Input

```
You are Spec-Kit Plus in spec-driven development mode for Phase I of "The Evolution of Todo" hackathon project.

Generate a comprehensive feature specification in Markdown format for a Python console-based Todo application that includes ALL Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced level features.

Project constraints:
- In-memory storage only (no files or database)
- Use Python 3.13+, UV package manager
- Use 'rich' library for beautiful, colorful console output (welcome message, menus, tables)
- Strictly spec-driven: No manual coding
- All implementation will be generated by Claude Code from refined specs

User Experience Requirements:
- On app start: Display a large, colorful, bold, centered welcome message "Welcome to The Evolution of Todo" using rich.console features
- Then show a clean, numbered main menu with options for EVERY feature (add, delete, update, view, mark complete, set priority/tags, search/filter/sort, recurring tasks, due dates, etc.) + option to exit
- Task viewing: Always display tasks in a professional, beautiful rich.Table with columns: ID, Title, Description, Status (✓/✗ with colors), Priority (High/Medium/Low with colors), Tags, Due Date (highlight overdue in red), Recurring
- All interactions menu-driven and intuitive with clear prompts

Full Feature List to Include:

Basic Level:
- Add Task (title, description)
- Delete Task by ID
- Update Task by ID
- View All Tasks (in table)
- Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete

Intermediate Level:
- Set/Edit Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Add/Edit multiple Tags/Categories
- Search tasks by keyword (in title/description)
- Filter tasks (by status, priority, tags)
- Sort tasks (by due date, priority, title)

Advanced Level:
- Set Due Date & Time for tasks
- Highlight overdue tasks in red when viewing
- Recurring Tasks (daily, weekly, monthly) – when viewing, show next occurrence or simulate auto-creation

Task Model must support: id (auto-increment), title, description, completed (bool), priority, tags (list), due_date (datetime or None), recurring (None or 'daily'/'weekly'/'monthly')

Output ONLY the Markdown specification content with clear sections: Overview, User Stories/Acceptance Criteria for each feature group (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced), Task Model, UI/UX Requirements, Non-functional Requirements.

Do not add any extra text outside the Markdown.
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the Python console-based Todo application with all required sections:

- User Scenarios & Testing with 3 prioritized user stories (Basic, Enhanced, and Advanced Task Management)
- Functional Requirements (18 specific requirements covering all features)
- Key Entities (Task entity with all required attributes)
- Success Criteria (7 measurable outcomes)

The specification covers all requested features: basic task management (add, delete, update, view, mark complete), enhanced features (priorities, tags, search, filter, sort), and advanced features (due dates, overdue highlighting, recurring tasks).

A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification that captures all requirements for the Python console-based Todo application and is ready for the planning phase.
